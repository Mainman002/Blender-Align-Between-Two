# Align-Between-Two 
Blender 2.8x, 2.9x, and 3.x addon.

 ### By AIG

This script allows you to align any object along an axis between the centers of two other objects. 

This little script can be assigned to a hotkey and used with "Script Shortcut" https://github.com/snuq/Script-Shortcut

or PME https://gumroad.com/l/pie_menu_editor

In Blender, press the N Key to open the Tools Panel, click "Align Panel", select 3 objects (where the last one selected is the one you want to align) and then press the ui button. or if you want keyboard control of it, RIGHT CLICK the "Align to Selected" button, select "Assign Shortcut", select your 3 objects as usual, press the Q key, and click "Align to Selected".
